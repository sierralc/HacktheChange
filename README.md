Based on the traffic flow, we will tell you when to go!
Flow & Go aims to facilitate the hybrid work model in Calgary among multiple companies. We do the work for you to provide you and your employees with a schedule that focuses on staggering which employees are to commute to work to reduce the amount of traffic congestion. This not only reduces commute time for employees, but overall it aims to reduce CO2 emissions of an individual. Our goal is to aid corporations with minimizing their carbon footprint and abiding by their corporate social responsibility, while also providing employees the benefits of a hybrid work model to increase productivity and reduce burnout. 
Here you can access your list of employees and their information, add or edit an employee and/or their schedule, and get a visual the final schedule. After employee information is added, we create a systematic schedule that you can choose to alter it if necessary.
